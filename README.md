This is a NetBeans project and after compile you must use with these instructions :
* First you must enter `Terminals` and `Non-Terminals` and click on **Go** button,
* Now the combo boxes are initiated and you are about to enter the grammar in CNF form (Do not forget that you must specify your own Start `non-terminal`),
* After that enter a word to check :)
